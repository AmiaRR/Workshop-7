# Workshop-7 

https://amiarr.github.io/Workshop-7/ 

For this task I made a simulation using walkers, I used ChatGPT to help adjust the colours of the walkers in my sketch. I didn't really understand what this task meant by 'real or imagined enity or environment,' but I could have developed my sketch more through further experimentation of the walkers, rather than just following the tutorial and making small adjustments.
